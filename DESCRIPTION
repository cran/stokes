Description: Provides functionality for working with tensors,
           alternating tensors, wedge products, Stokes's theorem, and
           related concepts from the exterior calculus.  Functionality
           for Grassman algebra is provided.  The canonical reference
           would be: M. Spivak (1965, ISBN:0-8053-9021-9) "Calculus on
           Manifolds".  Version stokes_1.0-8 is a reduced
           functionality placeholder pending upload of spray version
           1.0-16 to CRAN.
